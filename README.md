Club Waze - A mobile non-native web application allowing users to find clubs and bars around them based on real-time ratings from other users.
Users at a club/bar provide real-time ratings about their location: gender balance, drink prices, type of music, etc.
Other users can decide which clubs to go to based on the current state of the club (aggregate of recent user ratings).
